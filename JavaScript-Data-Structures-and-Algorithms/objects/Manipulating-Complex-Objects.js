//Manipulating Complex Objects
//Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible Data Structure. A JavaScript object is one way to handle
// flexible data. 
//They allow for arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, and objects.

//Here's an example of a complex data structure:

const ourMusic = [
  {
    artist: "Daft Punk",
    title: "Homework",
    release_year: 1997,
    formats: ["CD", "Cassette", "LP"],
    gold: true,
  },
  {
    artist: "Richard Jeremy",
    title: "Billie jean",
    release_year: 2022,
    formats: ["digital", "NFT", "CD"],
  },
];

//Accessing Nested Objects
//The sub-properties of objects can be accessed by chaining together the dot or bracket notation.
//Here is a nested object:

const ourStorage = {
  "desk": {
    "drawer": "stapler"
  },
  "cabinet": {
    "top drawer": { 
      "folder1": "a file",
      "folder2": "secrets"
    },
    "bottom drawer": "soda"
  }
};

console.log(ourStorage.desk.drawer);

//Access the myStorage object and assign the contents of the glove box property to the 
//gloveBoxContents variable. Use dot notation for all properties where possible, 
//otherwise use bracket notation.
const myStorage = {
  car: {
    inside: {
      "glove box": "maps",
      "passenger seat": "crumbs",
    },
    outside: {
      trunk: "jack",
    },
  },
};

const gloveBoxContents = myStorage.car.inside["glove box"];
//Accessing Nested Arrays
//As we have seen in earlier examples, objects can contain both nested objects and nested arrays. 
//Similar to accessing nested objects, array bracket notation can be chained to access nested arrays

//Here is an example of how to access a nested array:

const ourPets = [
  {
    animalType: "cat",
    names: [
      "Meowzer",
      "Fluffy",
      "Kit-Cat"
    ]
  },
  {
    animalType: "dog",
    names: [
      "Spot",
      "Bowser",
      "Frankie"
    ]
  }
];

ourPets[0].names[1];
ourPets[1].names[0];

//Using dot and bracket notation, set the variable secondTree to the second item in the trees
// list from the myPlants object.
const myPlants = [
  {
    type: "flowers",
    list: ["rose", "tulip", "dandelion"],
  },
  {
    type: "trees",
    list: ["fir", "pine", "birch"],
  },
];

const secondTree = myPlants[1].list[1];
